# Text-Mining-Adverse-Drug-Events-from-Social-Media

This piece of work explores various neural network architectures in order
to produce a named entity recognition sequence labelling model. The goal
of the research is to identify the most effective architecture for producing
this high-performance model. The objective of the model is to accurately
extract mentions of adverse drug reactions specifically from social media
posts. Through various iterations, a model was produced with an F1-score
of 85.8%, comparable with some of the highest performing research within
the field. This is achieved through the use of two bidirectional LSTMs to
predict the span of a named entity within a sentence. The domain being
both social media and medical related poses a number of difficulties, which
are discussed as part of the research.
